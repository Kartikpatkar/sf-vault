## ✨ Overview

**SF Vault+** is a modern, offline-first Chrome Extension built specifically for Salesforce Developers, Admins, Architects, Consultants, QA teams, and support engineers who manage multiple Salesforce environments daily.

Unlike traditional password managers, SF Vault+ focuses on:

* Salesforce credential organization
* Client-based folder structures
* Multi-org management
* Fast credential access
* One-click login workflows
* Local-first privacy

Whether you're managing:

```text
Client A
├── Production
├── UAT
├── SIT
└── Development

Client B
├── Production
└── Sandbox

Client C
├── Production

SF Vault+ helps you stay organized without spreadsheets, sticky notes, shared documents, or generic password managers.
